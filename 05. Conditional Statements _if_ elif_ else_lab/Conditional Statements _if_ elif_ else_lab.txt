Lab 5: Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
Objectives
Understand the concept of conditional statements in Python
Learn how to use if, elif, and else to control the flow of a program
Write scripts to compare values and handle different conditions
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python syntax
Familiarity with variables and data types
Lab Tasks
Task 1: Write a Script to Compare Two Numbers and Print Which is Larger
Step 1: Start with the Basics
Objective: Compare two numbers and identify which one is larger.
Script Outline:
Define two variables with integer values.
Use an if statement to check which number is larger.
Print the outcome.
Example Code
# Define two numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 20

# Conditional statement to compare numbers
if number1 > number2:
    print("Number 1 is larger")
else:
    print("Number 2 is larger")
Task 2: Extend the Script with elif to Handle the Equal Case
Step 1: Add an elif Block
Objective: Include an additional condition for equality between the numbers.
Implementation:
Modify the script to use elif for checking equality.
Example Code
# Define two numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 10

# Conditional statements with elif
if number1 > number2:
    print("Number 1 is larger")
elif number1 < number2:
    print("Number 2 is larger")
else:
    print("Both numbers are equal")
Task 3: Test the Script with Various Inputs
Step 1: Comprehensive Testing
Objective: Ensure the script handles all possible comparisons.
Implementation:
Test the script by changing the values of number1 and number2 to various combinations:
Greater than
Less than
Equal
Case Study Examples
# Test Case 1: number1 is greater
number1 = 30
number2 = 20
# Output: Number 1 is larger

# Test Case 2: number2 is greater
number1 = 15
number2 = 25
# Output: Number 2 is larger

# Test Case 3: both numbers are equal
number1 = 50
number2 = 50
# Output: Both numbers are equal

# Run the script and verify the outputs for each case
Conclusion
You successfully learned to use conditional statements to control program flow.
You mastered the basic syntax of if, elif, and else in Python.
This foundational skill is crucial for developing more complex logic in future programming tasks
